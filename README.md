# IceCube-PD-Neutrino

This repository contains python code for constraining pseudo-dirac mass for neutrino using the observation of neutrino emission from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 at IceCube.

## Acknowledgments  
This project is based on the public release of code from the IceCube Collaboration.  
The original code can be found at https://icecube.wisc.edu/data-releases/2022/11/evidence-for-neutrino-emission-from-the-nearby-active-galaxy-ngc-1068/.  
Modifications and adaptations have been made for analysing pseudo-dirac possibility of neutrino.
